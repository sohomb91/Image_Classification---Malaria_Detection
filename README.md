# Image_Classification---Malaria_Detection

The idea of this project is to create a model that, given an image of a Red Blood Cell, will be able to predict whether it is infected with Malaria or not!

We would be using a lot of custom images containing infected and uninfected images of RBC's and using that, we are going to predict whether an unseen image contains the infection or not.
